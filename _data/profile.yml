short_bio: >-
  I am Zhiyuan Liang, an undergraduate student majoring in artifical intelligence at <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" USTC</a>. 
  I'm currently an intern at <a href="https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/" NUS HPC AI Lab</a> under the supervision of Prof.<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/">Yang You</a>. 
  My research interests lie in computer vision, LLM, trusted LLM, RAG, and Agent systems. I am also interested in generative data research. 
  I am currently seeking a PhD opportunity. <br> I publish a lot of open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/WangRongsheng">🔗Github</a> <img alt="GitHub User's stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/wangrongsheng?style=flat-square">. I shared some of the datasets and model weights used by the project at <a href="https://huggingface.co/wangrongsheng">🔗HuggingFace</a>. I likewise like to post some small-parameter LM at <a href="https://ollama.com/wangrongsheng">🔗Ollama</a> to help people use it locally.
